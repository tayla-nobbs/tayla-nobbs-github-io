<h1>Javascript and the DOM</h1>

  <h2>Javascript, CSS and HTML.</h2>

 <p> While we have the HTML, who is the 'builder' and CSS, 'the artist'. These two friends alone 
  cant make a complete website- or make it function. We need to call in the third friend- javascript or 'the wizard.
  HTML is the builder, the one who stores the main body of text and images. Then we have CSS, the artist. Whose 
  job is to help stylize the HTML, using fonts, positioning, etc. Then we have the wizard, whos magical
  powers help to create a functional webpage, with autocompletion, user interaction with the website 
  and storing data. </p>
  
  
  <h2> Control flow and loops </h2>
  
 <p> The control flow is the order in which the code is run/executed. Code runs from top to bottom,
  and we can manipulate the programs execution using conditional statements or loops. the code should u
  run in the right order to work- like how you wouldn't go outside before putting on your clothes. 
  
  Loops helps us to repeat a task/function without having the write the code over and 
  over again. We'll set a conditional to repeat this code until a desired outcome. Say we 
  want to be fully dressed before leaving the house- the loop will repeat itself until 
  we have put on all of our clothing items and are ready to step outside. </p>
  
  

  <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
  
 <p> The DOM (Document Object Model) is the interface we use to manipulate certain
  elements within our web browser. The DOM is structured in a tree-like shape- having 
  a root base, followed by multiple different branches with even more smaller branches.
  We use the DOM to interact with elements such as HTML elements, changing CSS and adding
  interactive (events) to make our webpage useable.</p>
  
  
 <h2>Arrays and objects.</h2>
  
  <p>Arrays are the 'lists' we use to store certain imformation in our code. We then use 
  the array to grab certain items from the 'list' to manipulate. We do this by refering to 
  it by its number value [1, 2, 3]. expect that in code we start count from 0: [0, 1, 2]. </p>
  
  
 <h2>Functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
  
 <p> Functions allow us to perform an actions in our code. By creating the function, and giving it an action-
  we can use this and call it multiple times throughout our code.</p>
