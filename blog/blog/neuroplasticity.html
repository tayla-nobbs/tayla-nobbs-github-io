      <h1>The growth mindset </h1>


     <p> A growth mindset is the self-belief in your ability to improve through hard work and cultivating
      your efforts in a positive way. That you can change and grow through application and experience.
      We do this by changing our mindset away from the fear of failure, and seeing things as an 
      opportunity for learning. Through practice, being viligant of the fixed mindset thoughts like
      "i cant do this" and "these people are doing better than me", and changing the way we think 
      about our abilities. </p>
      
     <p> Over time this will improve our learning capabilities As we slowly develop the mindset of/
      wanting to improve ourselves and our skills, We become more resilient to tackle obstacles and work
      even harder to reach more and more success.</p>
      

     <h2> The growth mindset and Me. </h2>
      
     <p> While i always understood the ideas around reshaping how you view yourself and your abilities
      for the betterment of learning- I always found extremely difficult or still refused to adapt
      these into my life. Through my research I feel more sentimental about wanting to change how 
      i think about myself and my learning capabilities- even though I still believe im going to 
      find it challenging. </p>
      
     <p> through intergrating some key ways to develop a growth mindset, like being kinder to myself, 
      changing my inside voice to adapt a more positive outlook to learning and failing and 
      recognizing my skills as i go through the motions of learning- I will hope to improve significantly
      and feel less anxiety towards my learning journey. </p>
