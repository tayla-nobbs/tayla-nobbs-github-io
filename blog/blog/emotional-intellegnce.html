  <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>

  <p>Emotional intelligence is most defined as the ability to understand and manage ones own emotions, but
  also recognize and influence the emotions of others. The ablility to apply that wisdom to yourself 
  and to the world around you. More specific examples of emotional intelligence are self awareness; noticing
  your own patterns and behaviours and how they are triggered and how they affect others. Self regulation; 
  being able to proportion your emotional reaction to the given circumstances- control your impulses or manage
  conflict. Empathy; The understanding of others emotions with compassion and non-judgement. Social skills; 
  Active listening and positive communication and body language with others. </p>
  
  <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
  
 <p> EQ refers to your social and emotional compentencies/ability. IQ refers to your intellectual
  ability- using logic to solve problems, learn and understand information on a technical level. 
  ALthought both can overlap and link to each other- Its like the two sides of the brain- logical 
  and abstract. While emotional intelligence is more adept in others from birth, both can be learnt, developed
  and enhanced. IQ has been more prominent to measure ones overall intellgence, through standardized
  education/intellegnce tests. But in the modern time- EQ is being regconized as important for 'the
  real world' applications of everyday life. </p>

  <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
  
 <p> Emotional intellgence is important not only in a workplace setting- but also for everyday life. Being
  able to regulate ones emotions and to understand the emotions of others helps build relationships,
  reduce stress, defuse conflict with others, enhances social skills, sense of self and so much more. </p>
