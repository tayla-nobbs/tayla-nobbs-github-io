<h1> Sprint 1 Core </h1>

  <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. </h2>

  <p>During my hospo days- i found myself in a position where i had to let go of a career i thought i'd continue to be in for a long time. I had to debate
  with myself if this was a journey i wanted to continue, despite the strain it had put on me mentally and psychically. Althought I had so many fond 
  memories and was still interested in the ever changing industry- i decided it was time for me to move on and to start fresh and take a chance on 
  other interests i had pushed aside for years- like art school and web development. </p>
  
  <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
  
  <p>My connection to tangata whenua and the earth helps me to stay grounded and to look to community but also inward to help guide me. My friends and local community 
  inspire me to work hard, strive for more and to better myself. Everyone i surround myself around are creative, confident, and supportive. </p>
  
  <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey. </h2>
  
  <p>I believe my eye for aesthetics will help me tremendously on the creative side of my learning journey.</p>
  
  <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
  
 <p> I do find myself being anxious and giving up quickly when i get stumped or confused during a task. Usually during this I find it difficult to 
  get out of this state or to admit to others when im in need in help. </p>
  
 <h2> Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
  
  <p>In the pass i have dabbled in event organising for electronic music events. theyre are alot of people who have great ideas around 
  the organization, the ethos and general vibe, the layout for the venue or on the graphic design end. During this time it what helpful to 
  designate seperate jobs- while contribution of ideas was vital in keeping everyone happy and consistent- learning to allow the work to be done
  by one or a small number of people and trusting in their strengths and work. if tension arises- its up to the group as a whole to talk through what 
  is the most benefical for the project, and not for personal reasons. </p>
