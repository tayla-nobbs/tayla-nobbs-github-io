<h1>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h1>
<p>Class and id's are what we use to identify one or multiple elements of our code, to then refer
  to later when we use CSS (or styling) to change said elements. Think of it as 
  a series of tags/bookmarks that we can call back to to make changes to either a 
  single element or to a cluster of elements.
</p>
<h3> When to use ID vs Class:</h3>

<p> An ID is typically used to specify a single unique attribute. In CSS, we will
  call it using the hashkey (#), followed by the id name given. 
Class can be used when we want to manipulate multiple HTML elements. </p>

<p> A class tag allows us to define multiple elements at once. We call this on CSS using 
  a period (.).  </p>

  <h3> Here are some examples of ID and Class being used: </h3>
