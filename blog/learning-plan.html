<h1>Sprint 2 Core</h1>

<h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

<p>My long term goal is to feel confident in my skills and to achieve stability in terms of a fufilling job. As i understand more about the array 
of skills within Dev- I would like to discover what skills i excel at, "what is my thing?", and what skills i can then potentially use for creative outlets.<p>

<h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>

<p>my strengths is that i can adapt to environments easily, and am a quick learner in the right environment. Where i struggle is 
my reluctance to try when not given a push or guidance. I also find myself giving up easily when i am stuck. </p>

<h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

<p>I'd like to be able to better articulate myself when I am in need of support. To be able to clearly identify what im struggling with 
and be able to word out queries more efficiently. </p>

<h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme: </h2>

<p>I will work with myself to stay motivated and eager for learning with my peers and facilitators- remaining positive 
and supportive with my peers to build a community of understanding and excitement for each others success. I will work deeper
within myself to not disapear when things get hard- to push myself to ask for help or atleast let the people around me know
when im struggling. </p>

<h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

<p>Some things i think will be beneficial to me is periodic checks ins with facilitators to make sure im on the right track. In-person conversations
about work works easier for me as i am a visual learner- being able to show my work in real time to discuss and look through.</p>

<h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>

<p>I have no other time or whanau commitments. :]</p>

<h2> Learning Plan - Pre Bootcamp Reflection</h2>
<p>
  Through my journey so far in foundations, I have learnt that my strengths are more focused toward efficientcy- 
  and being able to visually see what can be done to make code shorter- or more efficient. But i also can see 
  my limitations on not giving myself checkpoints to console.log or check that my code is working along the way. 
  I can also see my strengths in being able to visualize what the actions needed to complete a task, even though 
  I can still be reluctant to start it if i am working on something alone. I am hoping through working 
  with others in bootcamp that i can work through this through group work. </p>[]
  
 <p> i think my biggest non-technical challenege will be staying on top of material and keeping focus. This is something 
  I know ive always struggled with in learning that i hope to overcome. I am hoping in my time at bootcamp that i can not only better articulate 
  myself when discussing something i am stuck on, but also articulate myself well when working with others by using the right syntax and 
  glossary words. developing this non-technical skill while at Dev will not only help me when im working with others- but also 
  in future work environments. </p>

  <p>During bootcamp I hope to create a good relationships with the bootcamp team, through checkpoint style talks 
    and an encouraging learning environment I hope to feel determined and commited to my learning. 
    Support in my learning throug an array of learning styles will help for the course content to solidify 
    into my brain. 
  </p>
  
 <p> i will continue to work with myself to stay motivated, through routine I will be able to focus my attention 
  between 'work time' and 'rest time'. Through foundations I have learnt about myself more and how i learn- 
  and can more easily sense the difference between when i actually need a break and when i am distracting myself, which 
  will help me during bootcamp to keep me commited to my work.
