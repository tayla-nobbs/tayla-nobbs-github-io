<h1>Sprint 2 Core</h1>
<p>
<h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>

My long term goal is to feel confident in my skills and to achieve stability in terms of a fufilling job. As i understand more about the array 
of skills within Dev- I would like to discover what skills i excel at, "what is my thing?", and what skills i can then potentially use for creative outlets.

<h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>

my strengths is that i can adapt to environments easily, and am a quick learner in the right environment. Where i struggle is 
my reluctance to try when not given a push or guidance. I also find myself giving up easily when i am stuck. 

<h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>

I'd like to be able to better articulate myself when I am in need of support. To be able to clearly identify what im struggling with 
and be able to word out queries more efficiently. 

<h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme: </h4>

I will work with myself to stay motivated and eager for learning with my peers and facilitators- remaining positive 
and supportive with my peers to build a community of understanding and excitement for each others success. I will work deeper
within myself to not disapear when things get hard- to push myself to ask for help or atleast let the people around me know
when im struggling.

<h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>

Some things i think will be beneficial to me is periodic checks ins with facilitators to make sure im on the right track. In-person conversations
about work works easier for me as i am a visual learner- being able to show my work in real time to discuss and look through.

<h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>

I have no other time or whanau commitments. :]
