  <h1> Problem Solving and Working through it.</h1>
  <h2>Feeling blocked on a problem:</h2>

  <p> During the superFizz buzz challenge I knew that for loops were still not my forte so when i 
  immedatiely was stumped on how to go about the challenge i knew i had to overcome this. I wanted to finish
  it quickly as i still on a roll from completing the previous fizzBuzz challenge but was quick to anger.
  I had to let myself have a break to clear my mind, and even though i still wasn't sure how to complete
  the challenege, i went back to previous exercises and resources on for loops to help me. During this
  process i've been more okay with not remembering all the infomartion ive learned in the past few weeks. 
  I am the kind of person that constantly go back and refresh on the material before its drilled into my brain.</p>

  <h2>Elegantly solving a problem</h2>
  <p>During the gradebook challenge, I knew exactly what i had to do, even if i didn't yet know how to apply it in code.
    I broke down what needed to be done in smaller steps, aswell as writing the first and last lines of code needed- 
    so i knew i had to get from point A to point B. Getting a pen and paper and drawing out the arrays, where they 
    were and where the evantually needed to be helped me tremendously and it felt good to 'take out' what was in my 
    brain and put it somewhere i can see and understand.</p>

  <h2>Problem Solving Techniques:</h2>
  <p>Pseudocode: pseudocode really helps me feel less overwhelmed by organizing my brain and breaking things down 
    into smaller steps </p>
    
    <p>Trying something: I still feel a sense of anxiety by trying things out, even when im by myself incase in dosent work.
    but i know its essential to learning so ive started to feel better about just running with something and
    giving it a shot.</p> 
    
    <p>Rubber ducky method: I really enjoy this method, although while im still in a state of not understanding how 
    things work either, i still struggle with trying to exlpain something i dont yet understand. </p>
    
    <p>Reading error messages: filtering through error messages is sometimes hard to navigate when theres alot on the screen. 
    But understanding what is 'expected' in a piece of code has helped me alot when i felt as im completely stuck.</p>
    
    <p>Console.logging: I have not practiced with console logging very often. </p>
    
    <p>Googling: googling has been a really big help and ive enjoyed using it when im stuck.</p>
    
    <p> your peers for help: While i still an apprehensive about using my peers for help, ive asked peers outside
    of dev for help which has been extremely helpful when i really dont understand or have become upset because of it.</p>
    
    <p>Asking coaches for help: asking my facilitator for help has been helpful, especially when i can screen-share and 
    have that real-time help. </p>
    
    <p>Improving your process with reflection: reflections have been a good way to really look back on my week. By the end of the week i usually forget everything 
    i have accomplished or learnt, So its been interesting to relfect back.
  </p>

  <h2>Asking for help and reluctancy</h2>
  <p>During this process I havent been very confident to ask for help- and i know thats due to my anxiety around
    looking stupid- or just flat out being to confused i dont even know what im confused about. I still feel reluctant 
    and want to try and be more open.  </p>
