<h1>Final Foundations core</h1>
<p>what surprised me the most about learning core was that ive always known about ideas surrounding
  mindfulness, emotional intellegence and learning about the self- and how that its beneficial 
  to us in alot of ways especially learning and applying those into work environments etc- 
  but i just brush it off to the side without believing in its benefits. But I can see 
  through research and reflecting on my time in foundations so far that they really are 
  helping me in my learning journey. I still find myself having lots of doubts, anxieties and 
  negative outlook on myself during these past few weeks, but I can see that through core 
  im unlearning alot of preconsived ideas about myself and how i deal with learning. 
  </p>

  <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>

  <p>1. that i have a bigger ego than i thought (lol)- my anxieties being more prominent than i realized and how 
    thats affected my learning/inability to reach out. 2. That i am capable of changing how i view myself and my 
    learning journey- through the growth mindset research, i felt a sense of relief that it was possible for me 
    to be better. and 3. that i still had alot to learn within myself. Reading back by first core blog- i didn't understand 
    yet what my strengths and values were at all. Im still unsure but am learning. 
    
    What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    
    values help us to stay aligned with our learning plan and how we can achieve those things. e.g 
    being fair, responsibility for ones self and possibly others and being understanding/having empathy
    for yourself and others. </p>

  <h2>Challeneges and Surprises Along the way</h2>
  
  <p>That at the beginning, i couldnt even consider or had an understanding of my work style, and as
    core learning has continued, i know alot more about myself than i had preconsived. And i am 
    still on that journey to understand myself in a learning environment. identifying my strengths is still a struggle for me, 
    perhaps because i havent been able to enable them just yet. Really looking in and seeing where my beliefs pre-foundations have been limiting
    myself and my learning journey. I know i still have many challeneges ahead with learning all this content, 
    and still having the mindset that i am not 'acadamically inclined'. But so far ive managed to surprise
    myself in many ways so i understand that its all apart of the journey. 

  <h2>Core learning</h2>
  <p>
    I think the core learning was definetly one of the reasons i decided to join Dev Academy! In any learning environment 
    and especially the future work place- where you usually see people sitting in cubicles all day- i think its
    important to take care of yourself mentally and psychically. Creating the learning plan helped me really pay attention to 
    what i need in moments of stress, and how a balance of work and rest is vital for learning. </p>
